# Box collider.
#
# The Box Collider is a basic cube-shaped collision primitive.
#
# Box colliders are obviously useful for anything roughly box-shaped,
# such as a crate or a chest. However, you can use a thin box as a floor,
# wall or ramp. The box shape is also a useful element in a compound collider.
#
# @require [Physijs Mesh]: this collider must be add to game object
# that has a Physijs Mesh

  #
  # @option options {Boolean} isTrigger If enabled, this Collider is used only
  #   for triggering events, and is ignored by the physics engine which simply
  #   means the player can go through it.
  # @option options {Object} center The position of the Collider
  #   in the objectâ€™s local space.
  #   default is undefined.
  #   example: {x:0,y:0,z:0}
  # @option options {Object} size the size of the Collider in x,y,z directions.
  #   default is undefined.
  #   example: {x:1,y:1,z:1}
